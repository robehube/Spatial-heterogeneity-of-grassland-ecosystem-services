# Spatial-heterogeneity-of-grassland-ecosystem-services
R code for the calculation of spatial explicit values of grassland ecosystem services

We here provide the R-code for reproducing the model results in the manuscript "Spatial heterogeneity and the economic value of grassland ecosystem services".
The code allows to: i) randomly distribute spatially explicit grassland use ii) calculate the biophysical estimates of ecosystem services iii) estimate the economic value of the grassland ecosystem services.

We here use sample data for illustrative purpose. Full data is available here:

Biophyisical data: DOI:10.3929/ethz-b-000386298

Economic data: https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12361
  

The code is structured into four segments
1) The random distribution of grassland categories in space. The code includes a the distribution on farm level.
2) The calcualtion of grassland yields (in t) and their economic value. 
3) The calcualtion of biodiversity (in species numbers) and their economic value.
4) The calcualtion of CO2 sequestration (in t) and their economic value.
